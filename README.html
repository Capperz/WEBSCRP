<p>Looking back at this project, my biggest regret is not starting early enough. The time constraint caught up on me very quickly and I have not been able to complete the project to a quality that I would have liked to implement. However the code I have completed, I am happy with and think that it is of good quality. I should have approached the task in a different manner, setting smaller goals for myself and an amount of time to complete them. </p>
